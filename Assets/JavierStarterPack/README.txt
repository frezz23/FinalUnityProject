Welcome to your starter pack. Since your game is revolved around Dialogue, it will be fairly easy to make. If there is anything else you want to your game, go ahead I won't stop you. Just make sure it is doable before Presentations.

Now in your starter pack, I have included:
* A land prefab
* Character walking script
* A character
* The Dialog script and a prefab
* An example scene on how to use the scripts together

The land is easy to make with Unity. You can go into the asset store and pull in trees and for the ground it self, you can just google "Seamless mountain ground" and download the PNG you want.

Good luck making you game. If anything, contact me or Jeands. Have fun!
